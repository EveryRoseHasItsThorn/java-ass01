Review Comments:

1. The code distribute into different parts with clear function name. (play music, play click sound, add background and help).

2. Majority of code is well-decomented from function level. However, the detail of local variable is not commented.

3. Generally the program seperate clearly. However, It would be better if we make a seperate class for music function cause there are too much staff in class viewer.

4. Almost all variable follows code convention with understandable variable name( apart from variable for loop, nothing named like"a" "b" "c")

5. there are some function that is not used(eg. showCompletion), maybe used for test and forget to delete.

6. prehaps there are some redundant is event handler function: the IDE shows part of code is not used. 

7. There are too much code in class card, view and WarringStatesGame. Create more class and transfer some function too that part.
