I submit the following for assessment as my best class.

* The constructor for Class Card (Reason: short code with two usage: move card based on game rule and trigger AI's next turn).
* The method genMove() in Class Robot.(Reason:flexiabilty: use the System.currentTimeMillis() to break out of a loop. The times of loop varies based on different input).
* The method userobot() in Class Card( Reason: simulate AI moves on the board.)
* The method showFlag() in Class Game( Reason: a smart way to show correct flags that each player have: just set it visiable or not)
* The mehtod updateBoard() in Class WarringGameState( Reason: short code to update the placement string after each move).
* The method nextLayer() in Class Robot(Avioding using complex data structure: represent a tree use list: flat it, each elements in tree represent a path from the root to a leaf)
