# java-ass02
A complete board game for a group assignement. The assignement is done by myself and my partner. I contribute 70% and she contribute 30%. 
This is the first big project I did. There are a bunch of classes inside the file and each of their has clear authorship and comments. It is 
quite a bueatiful design board game and I put lots of efforts on it. Have a look!
